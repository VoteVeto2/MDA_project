# CORDIS EU Research Projects Dataset (Horizon Europe 2021-2027)

## Overview
This dataset contains comprehensive information about research and innovation projects funded under the European Union's Horizon Europe program (2021-2027).

## Program Objectives
- **Tackle Global Challenges**: Support research in climate change, health, digitalization, and security
- **Boost EU Competitiveness**: Enhance Europe's leadership in science, technology, and innovation
- **Strengthen European Research Area**: Foster collaboration among EU countries and international partners

## Program Structure
Horizon Europe is organized into three main pillars:
