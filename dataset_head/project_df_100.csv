Classical anthropological theory once arranged basic economic types on an evolutionary ladder ranging from hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists, and agriculturalists to industrialists. Today, the existence of these economies other than industrialism are correctly approached not as anachronisms but as contemporaneous to (post-)industrial life. Still, research on digitization has largely taken place in (post-) industrial contexts, meaning we know next to nothing about how different types of longstanding economies adopt and adapt digital technologies. At the same time, researchers have stipulated that digitization threatens global economic diversity. By comparing digitization to processes of colonization, they have argued that digital technologies facilitate assimilation into (post-)industrial economic systems and their often capitalist values by virtue of their technological design. This project empirically investigates these claims through in-depth ethnographic research among hunter-gatherers (Brazilian Amazon), pastoralists (Kyrgyz Republic), horticulturalists (Solomon Islands) and indigenous agriculturalists (India) who have long resisted assimilation into industrial-capitalism. Additional ethnological comparison of the four sites will offer unique macro-level insights into the possibilities for economic diversity in the digital age. Finally, the project advances a novel theoretical and methodological approach that advances both ethnographic research and ethnological comparison. This approach recognizes the significance of both technological design and contextual adaptations and provides tools for new research agendas not just on digital industrial-capitalism but on diverse economic systems and values.",2023-12-26 14:40:12,259247,10.3030/101116741

JWST's ability to obtain infrared spectra of molecular ices condensed on interstellar dust grains in dense, star-forming clouds and in protoplanetary disks is expected to revolutionize the field, since these ices are known to be important sources of complex organic molecules. On a fundamental level, the physico-chemical behavior of these ices obeys the laws of molecular quantum dynamics occurring in low-temperature condensed phases. This is a forefront research area in chemical physics that, unfortunately, remains poorly understood. This project establishes an interdisciplinary, synergistic research consortium to address this knowledge deficit, bringing together the unique expertise of the groups of Alec Wodtke (Chemical Physics at Surfaces), Liv Hornekr (Astrochemistry and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) and Peter Saalfrank (Theoretical Quantum Dynamics). Under IRASTRO, we will develop and employ advanced infrared technology based on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for new experimental capability in laboratory experiments directly relevant to astrochemistry. We will combine megapixel SNSPD arrays with chelle spectrometers enabling solid-state mid-infrared emission spectroscopy, including single-molecule mid-IR spectroscopy in a scanning tunneling microscope. With these new experiments and forefront quantum theory, we will tackle three research themes: 1) Infrared Spectra of Molecules on Surfaces under Interstellar Conditions, 2) Energy Dissipation Channels on Low Temperature Surfaces, and 3) Chemical Reactivity under Interstellar Conditions. IRASTROs focus on IR spectroscopy will make the projects findings directly relevant to the interpretation of JWST observational data and, through a fruitful collaboration of experiment and theory, provide a better fundamental understanding of astrochemistry.",2025-02-24 17:23:14,268970,10.3030/101163161

Compartmentalization plays a key role in such precise molecular coordination and enables cellular function. Over the past decade, transformative experiments have revealed that most intracellular compartments are not enclosed by membranes, but instead they are dynamical assemblies, termed condensates, and thought to occur via liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules. Nevertheless, the misregulation of these condensatesmostly formed by proteins and nucleic acidscan give rise to deleterious solid-like aggregates, which are associated with the proliferation of age-related and neurodegenerative disorders.In-phase aims to develop an innovative computational approach to resolve the dynamical behaviour of molecules inside functional condensates that drift their complex physicochemical behaviour into pathological solid aggregates. To this end, we plan to develop a multiscale modelling platformcombining coarse-grained force fields and atomistic simulationswhich will address the following critical questions: What are the encoded molecular features in RNA and protein sequences regulating phase behaviour? What pushes biomolecular condensates to shift their material properties over time? Can we prevent the proliferation of pathological aggregates induced by condensate misregulation? The overarching goals of this project are: (1) to understand the thermodynamic and intermolecular forces driving condensates out-of-function; and (2) devise potential strategies for preventing RNA/protein aberrant phase transitions in biomolecular condensates. This alone is ground-breaking because it will reveal the underlying mechanisms and interactions by which the structure and sequence of RNA and proteins dictate the material properties of intracellular condensates, and their implication in cellular dysfunction.",2025-02-24 17:23:11,268969,10.3030/101160499

It is also the veil through which we peer into the extra-galactic universe. Its dust obscures our view of the formation of the cosmos. Its magnetic fields distort the observations of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. Its structure and metabolism determine the great diversity of observed star and planetary systems, including our own. Due to a lack of distance information, currently most information about the structure of the Milky Way is two-dimensional, while three-dimensional information is needed. For a breakthrough in Galactic cartography and the science it enables, we will create the first comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of all the physical components of the Milky Way. Our atlas will be self-consistent between component maps, quantify their remaining uncertainties, and be the most detailed to date. Thanks to the dramatic progress in observations at all wavelengths and in algorithmic methods based on information field theory in recent years, now is the right time to do this. Our team's combined expertise in galactic astrophysics, algorithms, observations, Milky Way surveys, and  information field theory with its application to galactic tomography puts us in a unique position to generate the first comprehensive Milky Way Atlas.

Luminescence nanosensing is a technology that promises all the features required to reliably monitor these parameters at the intracellular level: minimal invasiveness, remote working principle, and submicrometric spatial resolution. These features are ensured by the use of sub-micrometric sensors (particles) whose luminescence is sensitive to changes in the parameters to be sensed. Yet, despite the hype about luminescence nanosensing, its reliability in the study of cells is limited by interparticle variability in optical properties and sensing performance, simultaneous response to several parameters (cross-sensitivity), and lack of a measurement technology that enables fast 2D mapping of multiple parameters with sub-second temporal resolution. MAtCHLESS tackles heads on these limitations to develop a reliable luminescence sensing technology for multiparameteric sensing in cell studies. This project entails: design of a novel family of composite submicrometric luminescent sensors, elimination of interparticle fluctuations in optical properties using a spectral sorting strategy, introduction of the paradigm shift of making cross-sensitivity a desirable feature via machine learning, and use of a novel optical technology to build a setup for 2D mapping of multiple parameters with high temporal and spatial resolution. MAtCHLESS will test the reliability of the sensing approach in mammalian cell lines and extremophiles  microorganisms that can withstand extreme conditions of, e.g., temperature, oxygen concentration, and pH. These investigations will show the potential of the developed technology to monitor both slight and extreme changes in biological parameters, towards a deeper understanding of, e.g., how cancer can be more effectively treated, as well as how Life evolved on Earth and can be adapted beyond our planet.",2025-02-24 17:23:12,268966,10.3030/101162875

Key GR predictions are black holes (BHs) and gravitational waves (GWs), whose spectacular confirmation led to two recent physics Nobel Prizes. The future of GW astronomy, however, is even brighter, since detectors will observe BHs at cosmic dawn and probe their enigmatic event horizon, where GR clashes with quantum mechanics in the information loss paradox. These experiments will measure signals hundreds of times smaller than today, necessarily discovering anomalies and deviations from current predictions, e.g., due to the astrophysical environment. On the fundamental side, precision GW astronomy will open countless possibilities for understanding the standard model of particle physics (and its extensions), gravity and cosmology. By itself, however, precision is not knowledge. To harness the power of these measurements, a groundbreaking framework is urgently needed to solve the very nonlinear equations of GR and develop waveform models to unprecedented accuracy, and to convert these results into concrete interpretation tools. GWSky will leverage the world-leading expertise of its PIs in astrophysics, GW-source modeling, particle physics and GR, and recent paradigm shifts to build an overarching framework answering a fundamental question: When, inevitably, an anomaly in a GW signal is identified, what is it? A gravitational effect not predicted by GR? The influence of nearby matter? Or merely an imprecise calculation of the expected signal? Even tiny deviations from GR would shake physics to its core, but to claim a deviation from it, one needs to filter out first the contributions from the astrophysical environment, instrumental artifacts and systematic modeling uncertainties. GWSky will provide tools to disentangle these contributions, enabling precision GW astronomy with upcoming observational runs, and new facilities on the ground and in space.",2025-02-24 17:23:01,268968,10.3030/101167314

He not only purchased everything, incessantly, and everywhere, marking on the books place and date of purchase, the local price, and the conversion to Spanish currency; for accessing, managing and reusing his colossal library, he and his invisible technicians also developed a sophisticated cross-indexing and symbols system which is foundational in the history of bibliography and knowledge management. The Colombina library of Seville still preserves over one third of the almost 16,000 titles which Coln left at his death, as well a dozen manuscript indexes and catalogues that, recording all sorts of information, make it possible to reconstruct the lost portions of the collection, including the volumes famously shipwrecked on their way from Venice to Seville in 1521.

Of the nearly a million IVF cycles done in Europe annually (3 million globally), only 40% result in pregnancy. Low IVF success makes the process long, expensive, and emotionally devastating. Moreover, the dissimilar access to fertility treatments contributes to health inequity and gender imbalance, as infertility is still a women's social burden.One of the leading causes of IVF failure is embryo transfer (ET), with live birth rates (ET-LBR) below 30% and lower than 10% in women around 40 years old. The main factors affecting ET-LBR are embryo quality, uterine receptivity, and embryo-uterine synchrony. Nowadays, the selection of high-quality embryos is solved; but in the presence of high-quality embryos the uterus determines the success of embryo implantation. However, assessing the uterine readiness for embryo transfer is done by counting days.Therefore, an urgent unmet clinical need is to provide accuracy in detecting uterine receptivity and embryo-uterine synchrony to improve embryo implantation rates and IVF success.We have created Seedchrony, a point-of-care device that detects endometrial receptivity non-invasively, and instantly, enabling right-on-time embryo transfer to boost IVF success.

These open wounds need to be treated in the long term, resulting in annual costs of €27 billion. The treatment of chronic wounds is based on recurring medical examinations at intervals of 4 weeks, which include photographic documentation and a measurement of the wound. According to the current state of the art, this is simply done with a ruler, whereby the ruler is often inserted directly into the wound to assess the depth of the wound. This method not only leads to unreliable and non-reproducible results. It also takes up to 30 min. and is associated with massive pain for patients. To provide patients with relief and efficiently support wound healing, cureVision has developed a unique primary care device that enables fast and accurate documentation and analysis of chronic wounds. Our device contains multiple cameras and detectors that fully automatical analyse seven critical parameters without touching the wound itself. In addition to the wound dimensions, the integrated AI also automatically and reliably analyses the tissue components of the wound (%). Thus, for the first time, our mobile primary care device enables fast and accurate assessment for every wound to enable clinicians to adjust the therapy early. In addition to the significantly more comfortable, non-invasive examination for the patient, our device reduces the examination time by up to 60 %. The optimised therapy will reduce both treatment time and hospitalisation rates, resulting in annual cost savings of over € 40 million in Germany alone.

The main component of MRT contrast agent is gadolinium, which is a highly toxic rare-earth element, which has potential health side effects (inter alia allergic reactions and accumulation in the body) as well as environmental side effects (accumulation in the tap water).Due to the aforementioned issues, the reduction of contrast agent dose in cMRT is highly desirable. To tackle this issue, Katerina Deike-Hofmann from the Clinic for Neuroradiology at the University Hospital Bonn together with colleagues and collaborators from the Institute of Mathematics and Life Sciences developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm that allows for contrast agent reduction called SmartContrast.

These include Public Procurement of Innovation (PPI) and Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP), Value-Based Procurement (VBP), and Social Impact Bonds (SIBs).  Such demand-driven funding instruments have the potential to reduce the adoption gap in paediatric healthcare. However, these innovative funding tools are rarely used to support paediatric innovation adoption. This limited adoption of demand-driven funding tools can be attributed to several barriers which are specific to paediatric healthcare, such as the perceived high-risk and complex nature of bringing paediatric innovations to market, fragmented regulatory pathways and market access, limited market demand (low numbers of patients) and perceived small impact. Additionally, there is poor awareness, knowledge and understanding of demand-driven tools, which results in their underutilisation.

At the diagnostic step, a cystoscope is used. Usually, no biopsies are taken as there are no efficient methods to do so in the outpatient care. If the patient has suspected cancer seen on the monitor, they are scheduled for a surgery.  At the surgery step, the biopsies are taken and the cancer is removed using a resectoscope. The procedure is difficult to perform. The instrument used is hard (metal, up to 12 mm in diameter) and inflexible (can damage the urethra). There is a high risk of cancer reseeding elsewhere in the bladder. Up to 75 % of BC patients relapse within 5 years. The related costs in the EU are estimated at € 5 billion annually. No development has taken place since the 1960 when the existing instruments were developed.We have developed and patented the first medical device (called Multi4) which allows for local treatment of BC through flexible cystoscopy during one visit to the urologist. The instrument has 4 functions:  1. Inject local anaesthesia through a thin needle 2. Pieces of the cancer are cut by the specially coated forceps. Bleeding is stopped immediately.3. The cancer tissue is automatically transported out through the instrument itself. 4. When the forceps are closed, they become a burning electrode used to burn the surface where the cancer was located and ensure that all cancer cells have been killed.With the Multi4 platform, the patient can have their cancer treated at the first visit to the urologist.

Limited visualization with large challenges in identifying the cancer tumors position are a strongly contributing factor. The limited view from the surgical camera makes it challenging for the surgeon to navigate along the surgery procedure, not to mention removing the tumor with precise margins.Navari aims to revolutionize todays minimal invasive cancer surgery, by developing a technology increasing the visualization aspect during this type of procedure.

For instance, a quicker detection and allocation of dangerous germs and a closer monitoring of smallest traces of environmental pollutants like nano-plastics lead to a higher safety. Likewise, in the production process of high purity devices like ultraprecise lenses or semiconducting devices contaminations can lead to a change in functionality and understanding its origin is decisive. Our technology offers a new reliability to a powerful method – so-called surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy or “SERS”. Moreover, with our so-called “SERS-plasters” we enable the application of SERS on solid state surfaces which was up to now not possible, thus opening completely new industrial markets. Our technology is based on ultra-precise nanostructures that enhance the signals of the substances in question up to a billionfold. Our nanostructures consist of a novel material, and are fabricated by a scalable nanostructuring method, that was invented by us and tailored specifically to the material. The combination allows reproducible nanostructures and enables a new reliability in ultrasensitive detection.

Combining the capabilities of 3D printing in terms of bionic lightweight design with the lightweight nature of aluminium and its outstanding properties could lead to a revolution in the field of sustainable mobility. Despite the recent advances, 3D printing of aluminium alloys is a complex process that leads to many defects and a high scrap rate. This becomes a cost barrier to scale the technology especially in the sectors automotive and aerospace.   AMA proposes to develop a machine learning based toolpath with process parameters that are optimal to achieve a component defect free and first-time right. In the context of the project, we will provide science-based life cycle analysis of the indirect impact of our technology in enabling competitive sustainable solutions to scale by reducing the cost barrier and also compare the parts before and after using our AI technology in cost, quality and environmental impact criteria.  The technical objective will be achieved by designing a testbed demonstrator. For this, a specific Aluminium alloy (ALF357) and a representative geometry from the automotive industry will be selected. The AI process simulation algorithm will be trained with increasing geometry complexity. Once demonstrated the accuracy, the model will be used to achieve first-time right printing and avoid the traditional costly trial and errors.   The success of the use case will provide 1000Kelvin with a unique demonstrator, showing the capability of our AI based APIs to solve some of the complex process challenges of the AM industry.

A promising approach for more efficient thermal management is to directly embed liquid cooling inside the chip, eliminating the thermal resistance between the semiconductor die and the packaging. UniScool proposes a new patented and highly innovative liquid cooling system, based on an adaptive heat sink that includes a series of thermally activated fins capable of efficiently adapting the local heat extraction to time-dependent and non-uniform heat load scenarios, providing high-temperature uniformity without a custom design stage, avoiding overcooling and reducing the required pumping power, what provides an added-value solution that improves the existing ones.

Immunosuppressed patients are particularly vulnerable, with Diabetic Foot Ulcer Infections a leading cause of amputations in Europe. These patients are incredibly difficult to treat, requiring multiple surgeries, lengthy hospital stays and long-term antibiotics. In 20% of patients, an amputation is required to control the infection. Surgical intervention to remove infected tissue is the cornerstone of treatment but surgeons must balance removing infected material whilst preserving healthy tissue required for healing. Treatment Landscape:Current treatment modalities either only treat the surface of the wound or use mechanical forces to treat below the surface. Surface treatments fail as they leave infection below the wound bed untreated. Mechanical devices can cause more severe infections by damaging the integrity of the wound bed and propelling the infection deeper. As a result, these treatments are often ineffective, with 50% of patients requiring additional surgeries.XTremedy Solution:XTremedy Medical have developed a surgical device that delivers electrical signals through the wound.

A constant goal in almost all areas of electronics is miniaturization. Miniaturization leads to a reduction in strip thicknesses and places ever higher demands on materials in terms of strength, conductivity, and formability. The trend towards transmitting higher currents goes hand in hand with higher demands on the base material. A key requirement for materials is thermal relaxation resistance, which enables it to maintain spring forces and transmit currents.Soluterials goal is to develop, produce and to offer nano-structured lightweight materials. Based on Ms. Kasakewitsch's scientific work and doctoral thesis, we developed a nanostructured aluminium material InC and transferred the production process from laboratory to pilot industrial scale. InC is the material that meets contemporary requirements and sets the course for the future.  It’s a key enabling technology that will lead to far-reaching developments in downstream industries. The material properties are needed in all future industries, such as e-mobility, 5G, and electronics. For example, electrical conductors such as high-voltage cables could be constructed as self-supporting materials in future; in e-mobility, e-motors could be radically miniaturised.  InC opens up completely new possibilities for the miniaturisation of electrical components. In addition, like aluminium, InC can be produced cost-effectively on established production lines in one process step.Soluterials is a """"game-changer"""" in a multipurpose metal design (our customers can streamline their production by using only one instead of several metals/alloys for their different products/applications).

Hereby, EIT-H2Cities will break the circular conundrum of high production cost, low demand, no infrastructure, and address cities’ lack of capacity to build a replicable roadmap for local authorities looking to integrate hydrogen into their net-zero strategies. On budgetary division, in EIT-H2Cities the three KICs aim to consume less than 20% of the total costs. Defined innovation partners cover 48% of total costs and new legal partners will cover 32% of total costs. The decision to have legal partners within the XKIC is innovative in itself but also drives up co-financing and ensures city and industry full engagement in the initiative with a higher likelihood of financial success. Furthermore, EIT-H2Cities will build on programmes such as the Mission Platform and aims to become an umbrella association for wider engagement beyond the project lifespan, including for example district heating systems and local generation and storage. Our open partnership model will deliver EIT core KPIs on marketed innovation and SME/ Start-ups created, while a commercial pipeline and city replications will result from the experience of EIT-H2Cities. Dissemination, communication and exploitation activities will aim at inspiring follower cities and exposing citizens to the benefits of H2 applications in the mobility sector.  Overall, EIT-H2Cities is a unique opportunity for a highly relevant XKIC that responds to community needs and enables EU companies to gain skills, capacity and market share in a rapidly growing economic sector.",2023-06-28 16:57:54,251103,10.3030/101112701
