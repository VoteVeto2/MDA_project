Examples of such activities include e.g. scientific publications or communications or experimental datasets;- Exploitation activities (make concrete use of results): targeting the stakeholders which might take part in the exploitation of the project results towards the foreseeable outcomes (e.g. industry in the development of new products), these actions might rely in the Protection of Intellectual Property and take place from the end of the project (or as soon as there are exploitable results). Examples of such activities include e.g. roadmaps, patents, prototypes, regulatory recommendations, experimental datasets;- Communication activities (promote actions and results): targeting a widespread audience (stakeholders, citizens) and at engaging with stakeholders, experts, market and public as to raise awareness and show the success of European collaboration, these actions rely on public media (social media, web-based communication, tv, radio, newspapers) and take place from the moment the project starts until its end. Examples of such activities include e.g. website, newsletters, TV or radio interviews or newspaper articles.The coherent implementation of these impact maximizing measures follows the Integrated CD (Communication and Dissemination) Plan. To be followed along the project, this plan will describe Dissemination and Communication activities and procedures, as well as a list of all related documents and tools used in the framework of their implementation, to deliver and exploit the global message “MSA-Trough collectors will become the most economic technology for process heat generation, with a LCOH estimated at 2-3 €Cent/kWhth"""".""",101122276,MSA-Trough,https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e50a9f3931&appId=PPGMS,Project deliverable,2025-01-20 13:52:53,1243114
